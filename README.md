## CI/CD Applied to Android Project
I integrated "GitHub Actions" and wrote the script that runs the tests as well as build and generate an apk and make it available for download.
The apk is also uploaded to Firebase's "app distribution".\ 
This script is triggered automatically after each push on the master branch.
